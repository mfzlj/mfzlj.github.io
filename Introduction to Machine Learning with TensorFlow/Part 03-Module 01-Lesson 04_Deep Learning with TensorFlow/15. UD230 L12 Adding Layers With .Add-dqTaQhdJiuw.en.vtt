00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Now, let's look at another method that we can use to create models.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.170
This method involves using the add method.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.685
Let's see an example.

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.930
Here, we are creating a sequential model with no layers.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.325
We can add layers to this model by using the add method.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:21.480
The add method takes in as argument the layer that you want to add.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.500
Here, we're adding a flattened layer to add network.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.650
Since this model had no previous layer,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.270
then this will be the first layer of add network, and therefore,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.540
we have to specify the shape of our input tensor by using the input shape parameter.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.265
Any subsequent add statement will add a layer after the previous one.

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:47.525
For example, this add statement will add

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:51.140
a dense layer with 32 units after our flattened layer.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.650
Here, we can see a summary of our model.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.130
We can see that the name of this model is sequential_2.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:04.700
This is because this is the second sequential model in the graph created by tf keras.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.499
The add method can be very useful if you want to create large networks.

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:12.650
For example, let's suppose we wanted to

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.165
create a network with a large number of dense layers.

00:01:16.165 --> 00:01:20.075
In order to avoid having a large number of add statements,

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.725
we can use a for loop. Let's see an example.

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:27.740
Let's create a model that has six hidden layers,

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.710
where each of those layers is a dense layer.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.720
Instead of having six lines of code to add those six layers to our network,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.975
we're just going to use a for loop.

00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:41.570
To do this, we're going to first make a list that

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.210
contains the number of neurons in each of our six dense layers.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.000
Then we're going to create a sequential model with no layers,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.855
and then we're going to use the add method to add the input layer.

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:58.670
Next, we use a for loop that goes through our list and

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.060
uses the add method to add this dense layers to add network.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.650
Finally, we add the output layer.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.150
Here, we can see a summary of our model.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.670
This technique can be useful to easily create models with a large number of layers.
