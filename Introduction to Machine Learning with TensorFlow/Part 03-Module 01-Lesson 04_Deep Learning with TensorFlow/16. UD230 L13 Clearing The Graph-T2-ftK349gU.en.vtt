00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
The last topic I want to cover is how to clear the tf.keras graph.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.465
As we can see, our graph contains various sequential models,

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:13.695
various flattened layers, and various dense layers.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.835
In order to avoid cluttering the graph from old models,

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:22.785
we can use the tf.keras.backend.clear_session

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:27.165
to delete the current tf.keras graph and create a new one.

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:29.025
So let's see it in action.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:34.445
In this example, we're going to clear the graph and then create a sequential model.

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:40.555
As we can see, the graph has been cleared and it only contains the model we just created.

00:00:40.555 --> 00:00:42.590
That's it for this notebook.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.015
In the next notebook,

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:46.920
we will learn how to train our models.
