00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
So again, here's my solution.

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:04.030
We've done this a few times already.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.560
It's just our compiling of the model with Adam optimizer

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.780
sparse categorical cross entropy for loss and accuracy as our metric.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.630
Now I only ended up training this for two epics,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.205
and as you can see below,

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:20.070
it already got to a train accuracy of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.925
almost 99 percent and validation accuracy also of nearly 99 percent,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:25.770
which is pretty amazing.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.840
This, using a pre-trained model,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.670
really made a huge difference in what our model accuracy was.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.255
Here below we can check out our predictions

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:40.230
and see that we actually got them all right. That's great.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.115
99 percent accuracy, that means we're going to get almost everything correct.

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:49.190
So I encourage you here before you hop along to the project to go

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.060
ahead and play around a little bit more in the GPU workspace if you'd like,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.980
you can try different datasets, different networks, e.t.c.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.915
Remember, you do have a certain amount of GPU hours,

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:01.700
so if you're just writing code,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.700
I might suggest that you make sure you save your Notebook,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.130
but then disable the GPU until you're ready for training.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.625
Again, make sure you save it before re-enabling the GPU and

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:15.665
then you can train quickly with the GPU acceleration.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:20.580
So great, I hope you enjoyed this lesson and best of luck on the project.
